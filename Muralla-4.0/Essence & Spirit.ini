Essence & Spirit
Digital “command center” for entrepreneurs, creatives, and mission-driven teams who juggle many moving parts.
Values: clarity, autonomy, radical transparency, and continuous improvement.
Metaphor: a fortified citadel (“muralla”) that protects focus and amplifies collective intelligence; every wall is modular and can be rearranged as the organization evolves.
Mission
Enable any small-to-medium organization to run like a world-class operation—centralizing knowledge, processes, and insights—so teams spend time on impact rather than coordination.
Vision
A universally adaptable operating system where:
Processes document themselves as people work.
Decisions are informed by real-time data and shared context.
Workflows self-optimize through feedback loops and AI assistance.
Ownership is clear, communication is effortless, and creativity flourishes.
Core Functional Domains (What, not How)
a. Knowledge Hub – living wiki for policies, SOPs, and institutional memory.
b. Project & Task Orchestration – Kanban, timeline, calendar, and goal-tree views with nested subtasks and dependencies.
c. People & Roles – directory, role charters, performance snapshots, PTO tracking, and skills matrix.
d. Finance & Analytics – revenue/expense tracking, budgeting, KPI dashboards, and scenario planning.
e. Inventory & Asset Control – multi-location stock, procurement pipelines, and depreciation overview.
f. CRM & Community – unified customer/supplier records, interaction logs, and segmentation tags.
g. Events & Scheduling – booking, resource allocation, and post-mortem insights.
h. Notification & Automation Layer – rules engine for reminders, approvals, and real-time alerts.
i. Security & Permissions – role-based access with audit trails and compliance readiness.
j. Extensibility Gateway – plug-in architecture for third-party services, AI agents, and custom modules.
Design Principles
Modularity: every feature can stand alone or combine into larger workflows.
Progressive Complexity: starts simple, reveals power as needs grow.
Single Source of Truth: avoid data silos; everything referenceable via unique links/IDs.
Human-Centric UI: minimal cognitive load, dark/light themes, inclusive accessibility.
Data-Informed Decisions: dashboards everywhere; metrics tied to actions.
Automate-then-Elevate: repetitive tasks handled by the system so humans focus on strategy and creativity.


Home Hub (Dashboard) — Experience Design Blueprint ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Overall Purpose
Give every user a calm “mission control” that answers three questions at a glance:

Where do we stand? (Overview)
What just happened? (Recent Activity)
What should I do next? (Quick Actions)
Layout & Visual Hierarchy
12-column responsive grid (mobile → desktop)
Header strip: workspace logo + team switcher, search, global create (+), notification bell, profile dropdown
Main body split into three vertical zones:
A. Overview widgets (top)
B. Recent Activity feed (left/center)
C. Quick Actions panel (right sidebar on desktop; collapsible drawer on mobile)
Overview Widgets (Zone A)
Goal: surface real-time pulse metrics, tailored per role.
Widget library (drag-to-reorder, add/remove):
Today’s Focus — count of tasks due + unassigned tickets
Financial Snapshot — current bank balance, revenue MTD, spend MTD
People Pulse — who’s on shift / out today, upcoming birthdays
Inventory Watch — low-stock SKUs, pending POs
Event Radar — next three events with status badges
Design details:
Card style with subtle elevation; color-coded accent bar matching module (e.g., green = Finance)
Hover reveals mini-trend sparkline or “View report” link
KPI values animate on load (count-up 400 ms) for liveliness
Personalization: first-time users get a default set; power users choose from full catalog via “Customize Dashboard”
Recent Activity Feed (Zone B)
Goal: give instant context on what the org/team just did.
Structure: reverse-chronological stream; each item is a compact card.
Content types (icon-coded):
Tasks moved/closed, comments added
New transactions (invoice paid, purchase order created)
CRM notes or new contacts
Inventory adjustments or sales orders
Event bookings or updates
Interaction:
Inline actions: “Reply”, “Open”, “Mark as read”
Filters: All, My Teams, Mentions (@me), Systems (automations)
Infinite scroll + “Jump to top” on new item arrival
Real-time updates via WebSocket; unseen items badge appears in tab title for attention.
Quick Actions Panel (Zone C)
Goal: reduce friction for frequent tasks.
Components:
Smart Suggestions — top 3 actions predicted by usage/time (e.g., “Log Expense”, “Create Task”, “Record Sale”)
Action Buttons grid (icon + label):
New Task / Project
Upload Document
Record Payment
Book Resource
Add Contact
Start Timer (time-tracking)
Keyboard shortcuts tooltip (e.g., “N + T” for New Task)
“Automation Recipes” dropdown: launch pre-built multi-step flows (e.g., “Onboard New Hire”)
Adaptive & Accessible Design
Dark/light theme inheritance from workspace settings
High-contrast mode toggle for accessibility
All interactive elements ≥ 44 × 44 px touch target
Live-region ARIA announcements for feed updates
Localized strings; date/number formatting via workspace locale
Performance & Data Principles
Lazy-load widgets not in viewport; skeleton loaders < 200 ms
Cached API responses with 60-sec revalidation to avoid flicker
Real-time events debounced to 1 update/sec to prevent UI thrash
Privacy scopes: widgets show only data the user’s role permits
Empty & Edge States
First day: friendly illustration + “Let’s personalize your Home Hub” walkthrough
No recent activity: show contextual tips (e.g., “Invite teammates” button)
Widget error: red border + “Retry” icon, never blanks the card area
Extensibility
Marketplace plug-ins can register new widgets, feed event types, or quick-action buttons via a documented SDK
Admin can set mandatory widgets for all users (e.g., Compliance Alert)
By combining a flexible metric board, a live activity stream, and friction-free shortcuts, the Home Hub keeps every role aligned, informed, and ready to act within seconds of logging in.

Realtime: Socket.IO gateway inside NestJS (same auth guard)
Background Jobs: BullMQ (Redis-backed) for long tasks & scheduled jobs
Containerisation: Docker Compose for dev; optional Helm chart for K8s prod
Package manager: pnpm (monorepo-friendly, fast)
Modular Domain Packages (single repo, apps/api/src/modules)
01 auth – JWT/OAuth2, magic-link email, 2FA
02 users – profiles, roles, permissions (RBAC/ABAC)
03 knowledge – wiki pages, policies, versioning
04 projects – tasks, boards, Gantt, comments
05 people – shifts, PTO, performance records

Cursor-based pagination everywhere
Realtime subscriptions mirror GraphQL queries (taskUpdated, stockLow)
File uploads via S3-compatible object storage (e.g., MinIO for on-prem)
Security & Compliance
Global rate limiter (Nest throttler) + helmet headers
Field-level auth guards (ability‐based CASL)
Row-level security in Postgres for company isolation—even in multi-tenant future
Audit trail table capturing before/after JSON diff per write
Secrets via .env + Vault/SealedSecrets for prod

ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks
Jest unit tests; Supertest e2e per module; coverage gate ≥ 80 %
Storybook / Mock Service Worker for frontend consumers
Example fixture loader for demo data
CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Lint → Test → Build Docker image
Push to GHCR
Staging deploy via docker compose up --pull
Prod promotion with manual approval or tag push
